# Captain’s Log
For [NaNoGenMo 2016](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2016).

_Captain’s Log_ generates 50,000+ words of luckless captains and their endeavours in the style of [Emily Short](https://emshort.blog/)’s superlative [Annals of the Parrigues](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B97d5C256qbrOHFwSUhsZE4tU0k/view?usp=sharing).

_Captain’s Log_ does the following:
1. Pick a random captain and ship from curated lists.
2. Pick a random starting location from a collection of geo-tagged East India Company ports.
3. Search through all the other locations for the nearest one and calculate the cardinal direction.
4. Set sail!
* occasionally encountering hostile vessels
* usually arriving at the specified destination
* always ending with tragedy
5. Rinse, repeat.
6. Output it all to an HTML file.

You can see the latest output [here](https://github.com/eoinnoble/captains-log/blob/master/output/captains-log.html), but I don’t recommend you read through it in its entirety. Instead, I’ve picked out some key pieces below:

![January, 1767 My name is Jacob Collaart, captain of the pinnace “San Nicolás”. We set sail from Bangka Island, heading northwest to Sulu. This is my log.](https://github.com/eoinnoble/captains-log/blob/master/output/images/cl1.jpg)

![January, 1770 Able seaman Jones did his best, but his impersonation of a particularly attractive albatross did not succeed in luring a meal out of the skies.](https://github.com/eoinnoble/captains-log/blob/master/output/images/cl2.jpg)

![February, 1768 We set sail from Tapian Nauli, heading north to Thanlyin. We arrived at Thanlyin after 2 days’ sailing. The people here are purposeful and thorough, recognised for their curious pickles.](https://github.com/eoinnoble/captains-log/blob/master/output/images/cl3.jpg)

![April, 1770 We set sail from Tamsui, heading east to Keelung. We arrived at Keelung after 1 days’ sailing. The people here are tardy and heedless, famed for their imbecilic librarians.](https://github.com/eoinnoble/captains-log/blob/master/output/images/cl4.jpg)

![December, 1768 I’m deeply concerned about the crew, some of them are coming to the end of multi-year hangovers in the beating midday sun and remembering they’re still on my ship. I worry they might unionise… We came across a threatening galleon with dozens of cannon, flying a Portuguese flag, seeming to fly towards us. We passed across their line and commenced a very severe action, with the result that the entire mizzen mast, the aft most of the ship’s three masts, is shot away along with all the standing & running rigging sails etc. Look at what I have done…](https://github.com/eoinnoble/captains-log/blob/master/output/images/cl5.jpg)

![March, 1767 We set sail from Dhaka, heading southwest to Simon’s Bay. Thus ends the tale of the “San Nicolás” and her captain, Jacob Collaart – lost to either cannibalism or sobriety, pray we never discover which…](https://github.com/eoinnoble/captains-log/blob/master/output/images/cl6.jpg)
