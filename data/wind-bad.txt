The pleasures of being becalmed become threadbare; there is a limit to untutored star gazing.
A profound stillness pervades the water. Not a breeze from any direction!
Motionless rests the sea, and I anxiously scrutinise  the smooth surface of the water all around.
In the vast expanse, not so much as a ripple stirs. The horrible deathly calmness!
The crew grows restless with our lack of progress, but the winds have forsaken us this day.
The sails hang limp and lifeless. Each man can feel the weight of air, the weight of himself.
Here we lay forty-eight hours, during which the cold was intense. I wondered at the liquid sea, which refused to freeze in such a temperature. The clear, cold sky overhead looked like a steel-blue cymbal, that might ring, could you smite it.
