I’ve ordered the first mate to water down the rum to make it last, but some of the crew are starting to sober up…
Able seaman Smith has gone blind after drinking a foul-smelling liquor distilled from old boots. The crew are getting desparate.
Our rum is all but exhausted, the rousing sea shanties that used to herald our passage are mere echoes in my mind.
The crew’s rum ration barely deserves the name, sometimes I worry they can smell my special reserves on my breath.
I’m deeply concerned about the crew, some of them are coming to the end of multi-year hangovers in the beating midday sun and remembering they’re still on my ship. I worry they might unionise…
The meagre rum rations are no longer sufficient to take the edge off this biting cold.
The first mate confiscated some noxious distillate from the crew this morning. There appears to be a weevil at the bottom of the bottle. It is surprisingly palatable.
With the rum running out I have ordered the ship’s doctor to store his alcohol supplies in my cabin for safe keeping.
