Provisions are running low, and the crew is starting to starve.
I’m so hungry even the first mate is starting to look appetising…
It is a dark day – the hunger got so bad I had to eat my second-best pair of boots. I got the cabin boy to tenderise them but it made no difference.
I haven’t seen able seaman Morris in some time, but at least the crew aren’t complaining about the lack of provisions right now…
Able seaman Jones did his best, but his impersonation of a particularly attractive albatross did not succeed in luring a meal out of the skies.
I had to break up a fight amongst the crew today over a particularly juicy weevil someone found in a barrel. I took the weevil back to my quarters for safekeeping until the rightful owner can be determined.
