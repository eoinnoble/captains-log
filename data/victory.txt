We prevailed, thanks to the officers and crew of the ship who supported me during the several actions with a steady coolness and determined intrepidity.
Our ships smashed into each other, our anchors locking us together. We set about reducing them to kindling by firing our guns alternately high and low. 
We passed across their line and commenced a very severe action, with the result that the entire mizzen mast, the aftmost of the ship’s three masts, is shot away along with all the standing & running rigging sails etc. Look at what I have done…
We saw them off, but there are some supply losses to catalogue: William Hetherby, bed & bedding, 1 outside jacket & 1 hat; Walter Hewen, 1 bed & bedding, 1 cotton shirt, 1 pair white trowsers, & 1 black silk handkerchf; and Josh Daniel, 1 bed & bedding, 1 pr blue trowsers, 1 hat & 1 pr shoes”.
Made quick work of them, but many wounded: Adam Ross, landsman, compound fracture of the leg; William Finlay, able seaman, wounded dangerously by splinters; William Meyers, able seaman, badly cut in back and thighs splinters severe; William Kelson wounded in cheek and eyeball by splinters.
